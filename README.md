Credit goes to stackoverflow, most of the code was tweaked from here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13249168/get-element-by-classname-script-not-working
# How to use:
1. If you are going to make a bookmarklet go to [here](https://github.com/thatrandomperson5/ichinese-clientside-trick/blob/main/bookmarklet.md#how-to-use), there will be insturctions there.
2. If you are just injecting through the url go to the same place and inject instead of using a bookmarklet.
3. If you just want to use the console(f12) use the code from [here](https://github.com/thatrandomperson5/ichinese-clientside-trick/blob/main/all-books-xpbar.js) and paste it in and click enter.
